    "Alice is a stock broker who owns two types of assets: A and B. She owns 100 units of asset A and 50 units of asset B. The current interest rate is 5%. Each of the A assets have a remaining duration of 6 years and pay $1500 each year, while each of the B assets have a remaining duration of 4 years and pay $500 each year. Alice would like to retire if she can sell her assets for more than $500,000. Use vector addition, scalar multiplication, and dot products to determine whether she can retire."
