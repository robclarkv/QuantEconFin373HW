    "One way to check whether the numpy random numbers approximate the mean and variance of the Uniform(0, 1) distribution is to generate a large sample of random numbers using the numpy function, and then calculate the sample mean and variance of the sample. The sample mean should be close to the population mean of 1/2 and the sample variance should be close to the population variance of 1/12, if the numpy random numbers are a good approximation of the Uniform(0, 1) distribution.\n",
